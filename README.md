# AI-Driven Personal Finance Advisor System

## About the Project

This project is a prototype of an AI-driven personal finance advisory system.
It analyzes an individual's income, expenses, debt, and savings to assess
financial risk and provide personalized recommendations.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI and data-driven logic can be
used to support better financial decision-making in real-world fintech systems.

## How It Works

The system follows a structured approach:

1. **Financial Data Processing**
   - Calculates debt, expense, and savings ratios

2. **Risk Prediction**
   - A Logistic Regression model is trained on sample financial data
   - Predicts overall financial risk (Low / Medium / High)

3. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Generates practical suggestions based on risk level and financial behavior
